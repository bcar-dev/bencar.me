Welcome to **bencar.me**!

## Why a personal website?

As a backend developer, I spend most of my time deep in code, designing systems, and most importantly solving problems.

I've always felt that writing about what I do helps me think more clearly, and sometimes, those thoughts are worth sharing, I mean hopefully.

So this is first and foremost for me, but I hope it can be useful for others too.

What I'm planning to write about:

- **Software development** - architecture, patterns, and what I've figured out building things
- **Artificial Intelligence** - what actually works in production, navigating the hype, and my latest experiments
- **Biking** - my way of unplugging and exploring, some of my favorite routes and experiences, moments I share with my friends on the bike
- **Life** - reflections, ideas, and everything in between

## The tech stack of this site

This site is built with:

- **Next.js** (React) for the framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Markdown** files with YAML frontmatter for managing blog content
- A simple file-based content system - no CMS, no database, just `.md` files

I wanted something lightweight that I could fully control. Writing a post is as simple as creating a new markdown file, and that feels right.

## Inspirations and credits

This site is largely inspired by [Peter Steinberg's own blog](https://steipete.me/). Although I've taken a different approach to the tech stack, the overall design and layouts are similar.

I was really seduced by many things:

- how the design feels, the colors, the typography, the simplicity
- how it's intuitive to navigate
- how easy it is to write a post, just create a new markdown file and voilà!

Looking at his source code allowed me to learn about Astro, which looks like an excellent fit for building static sites with Markdown. However, I wanted to see if I could recreate it with React, Next.js, and Tailwind, as that is a tech stack I'm a bit more familiar with.

Although I had to add a bit more configuration to the project to make it work with React, it still does the job.

## What's next?

I plan to write regularly. Some posts will be technical deep-dives, others will be more casual reflections. If you're here, thanks for reading - and stay tuned.
